        <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-riented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for variety of reason. It is small and lightweight languegae allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with cofee, the cup holds the the coffee a variable holds the value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with uniuqe names. These unique names are called identifiers, <span>var x;</span></li>
            <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operatos assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The assginment operator assigns a value to a variable <span>var x=10;</span></li>
            <li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept, to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six types that are JavaScript primitives; Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothin; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
                    Array - <span>[1, 'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name:'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}</span></li>
            <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different  actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that ahve been met. You can use conditional statementa in your code to acomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code blocks;
                <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
            <li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all assentially do the same thing; they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track for times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
            <li><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we can call our function this wull run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our functions over and over and over again.</li>
