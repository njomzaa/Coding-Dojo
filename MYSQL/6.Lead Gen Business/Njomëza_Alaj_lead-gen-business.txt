Lead Gen Business

--------------------------------
1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_revenue, MONTHNAME(charged_datetime) as month, YEAR(charged_datetime) as year
FROM billing
WHERE charged_datetime BETWEEN '2012-03-01' AND '2012-03-31';


2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?

SELECT clients.client_id,clients.first_name, SUM(amount) as total_revenue from clients
LEFT JOIN billing on clients.client_id=billing.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id = 2;

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?

SELECT domain_name, client_id 
FROM sites
WHERE client_id=10;



4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?

SELECT COUNT(site_id) as no_sites, MONTHNAME(created_datetime) as month, YEAR(created_datetime) as year
FROM sites
WHERE client_id = 1
GROUP BY month,year;

ÔÅÆ	client=20
SELECT COUNT(site_id) as no_sites, MONTHNAME(created_datetime) as month, YEAR(created_datetime) as year
FROM sites
WHERE client_id = 20
GROUP BY month,year;


5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

SELECT sites.domain_name as website, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads,
registered_datetime  
FROM sites
LEFT JOIN leads ON sites.site_id=leads.site_id 
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011/01/01' and '2011/02/15' 
GROUP BY sites.site_id;

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1,
 2011 to December 31, 2011?
 
SELECT clients.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name) as client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS no_leads
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
LEFT JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31'
GROUP BY clients.client_id;

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between
 months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?
 
SELECT clients.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name) AS client_name,
COUNT(leads.leads_id) as total_leads, MONTHNAME(leads.registered_datetime) as month
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
LEFT JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-06-01'
GROUP BY clients.client_id, month;


8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients'
 sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  Come up with a second query that shows
 all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name) as client_name, sites.domain_name,
COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS no_leads, DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, "%M %d, %Y") AS date
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
LEFT JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-01'
GROUP BY sites.site_id, sites.client_id;


SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name) as client_name, sites.domain_name,
COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS no_leads, DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, "%M %d, %Y") AS date
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
LEFT JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-01'
GROUP BY sites.site_id, sites.client_id;

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.

SELECT clients.client_id, CONCAT(clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS client , 
SUM(billing.amount) AS total_revenue, 
MONTHNAME(billing.charged_datetime) as month,
YEAR(billing.charged_datetime) as year
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN billing ON clients.client_id = billing.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id, year, month
ORDER BY clients.client_id;

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client.
 It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)
 
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, " ", clients.last_name) as client, 
GROUP_CONCAT(sites.domain_name) as sites
FROM clients 
LEFT JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id;
